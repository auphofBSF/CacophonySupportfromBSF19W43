### Issue of incorrect image GAIN or AGC issues possibly related to FFC



There is a variance in the recording qualtiy  that would appear to be related to AGC and FFC affecting the gain

Interestingly the camera never changed position for night of 2nd Nov yet only 57% of recordings had issues

for night of 3 the camera was repositioned to show less of the flax and the incidence of GAIN/AGC issues was reduced. Camera remained in position for night of 11/4

for Night of 11/5 the camera was deployed to a new site where rodent activity was expected. Warm building and brick foot path seem to be affecting GAIN/AGC?



Period beieg observerd is 2019-11-01 onwards
and results to Night of 5th Nov just gone
